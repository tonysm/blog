        Hi, I'm Tony Messias. I've working writing web applications since 2010. I work remotely for <a href="https://madewithlove.be/">madewithlove</a> as a Software Engineer.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-6">
        Every now and then I try to share things about what I'm learning through my <a href="{{ '/articles' }}">articles</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGtfJjAR5JeBPAmxN_ZHx4Q?view_as=subscriber">screencasts</a>. You can also find me on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/tony0x01">@tony0x01</a>.

    <p class="mb-6">
        I'm a co-founder and one of the organizers of a Meetup group called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/maceio-dev-meetup/">Maceio DEV Meetup</a>, where we try to group monthly to discuss many different topics, from servers to selling software. If you're in town (Macei√≥/AL), reach out.
